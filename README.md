# ASC Media Hash List (ASC MHL) – Specification

> This repository is the home of the ASC Media Hash List (ASC MHL) specification and related documents. The specification is developed by the Advanced Data Management Subcommittee of the ASC Motion Imaging Technology Council (MITC) at the [American Society of Cinematographers](https://theasc.com/) (ASC).

## Introduction

Ensuring file integrity when backing up and verifying files during production and post-production is of utmost importance. The ASC MHL is used to create a chain of custody by tracking each and every copy made between the media’s initial download on set, all the way through to final archival.

The ASC MHL uses common checksum methods for hashing files and folders, specifies what information is gathered, where the checksum is placed, and documents these hashes together with essential file metadata in an XML format.
